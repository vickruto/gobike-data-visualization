## by Victor Ruto


## Ford GoBike Dataset

> The Ford GoBike datasets are a set of publicly available datasets concerning rides made in the Ford GoBike bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The Ford GoBike service is a bike sharing system that was launched in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2017. It is owned and operated by Motivate International Inc. The datasets are available for download [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html)

> The dataset from February 2019 consists of records of about 183,000 rides.
The data features include duration of the rides, the location of the stations where the bike trip started and ended, the datetime, anonymized customer information such as customer type, birth year and gender and some other additional variables.

## Summary of Findings

> Rainfall significantly affects the number of trips, especially on the first day when there is a sudden increase the precipitation levels
> During the weekdays, the number of rides peak twice : during the morning and evening commute hours while during the weekends and holidays, the number of rides peak once during the day in the afternoon.
> The Bike Share For All Program has been very successfully adopted in the East San Jose while in the other regions, the program has not been very successful.
> Most of the rides are during the commute hours. This probably means that most of the people using bike share services for their commutes to and from work.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The presentation is focused on displaying the main factors affecting the bike ride duration and ride distance such as external conditions such as rainfall and distribution of bike stations within a location as well as the rider demographics such as age and gender. The presentation is also focused on comparing the demographics among the regions and what causes the different bike share service usage patterns in the distinct geographic regions.
